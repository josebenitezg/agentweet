ðŸ“š New paper: Segment Everything Everywhere All at Once ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“·


Inspired by the development of prompt-based universal interfaces for LLMs, this paper presents SEEM, a promptable, interactive model for Segmenting Everything 

Everywhere all at once in an image. SEEM has four desiderata: 

âœ… Versatility: by introducing a versatile prompting engine for different types of prompts, including points, boxes, scribbles, masks, texts, and referred regions of another image; 
âœ… Compositionality: by learning a joint visual-semantic space for visual and 
textual prompts to compose queries on the fly for inference as shown in Fig 1; 
âœ… Interactivity: by incorporating learnable memory prompts to retain dialog history information via mask-guided cross-attention; and 
âœ… Semantic-awareness: by using a text encoder to encode text queries and mask labels for open-vocabulary 
segmentation.
